***   HERE IS SOME HELPFUL INFORMATION   ***


* This program defines a priority based preemptive scheduler where:
   - Process with highest integer value has highest priority.
   - Round Robin algorithm for processes with same priority.
   - Round Robin has time quantum 10 time units.
   - Default program output prints execution details, waiting and turnaround times for processes.

		 ** USAGE **

* The program needs a tab separated .txt file as argument 1 in the following format for each line
   processnumber as (String)    tab   priority as (int)   tab   burstTime as (int)   tab   arrivalTime as (int)   newline
   i.e.: P12\t8\t18\t3\n indicates Process 12 has priority 8, burst time of 18 time units and arrives at time unit 3.

		 ** OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS **

   -help      -> Prints this message to console.
   -timeline  -> Prints a timeline for the process execution.
   -report    -> Prints a detailed report of all processes executed
   # These optional arguments can be passed in any order AFTER the input text file argument
   # The parameter -help at any position overrides all other parameters.   # Any non argument not listed here will cause this message to be printed

		 ** COMPILATION AND EXECUTION **

   g++ -c vagner.c          -> compiles the source file into object file
   g++ -o app.exe vagner.o  ->  links object file to executable
   ./app.exe {inputFile.txt} [-help] [-timeline] [-report]  -> runs program with data from inputFile.txt and optional arguments if desired
